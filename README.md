## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This Python-based CLI-based chat bot communicates with users via a command line interface and has natural language conversational capabilities. To respond to user inputs, the chatbot employs the ChatGPT API, a sophisticated language model based on neural networks.

The application asks the user for input and then uses the ChatGPT API to process the text to produce a response. The user can read the response after it is displayed in the command line interface. Depending on the user's input, the chat bot can handle a wide range of topics and can either provide basic information or engage in more specialized dialogues.
